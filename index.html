    <h1>My Pet Website</h1>
    <h2>Cats and Kittens</h2>
    <p>Pets are really awesome animals don't you think?</p>
    <br>
    <p>Some give you comfort, others love, and some, just like  my personality, give you stone cold savagery and sarcasm! Welcome to Kitty the rowdy kitten!</p>
    <p>So I got kitty from a pet store in Alabama, didn't even buy her but this is how she makes me feel</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Ugly</li>
      <li>Unwanted</li>
      <li>Ignored</li>
      <li>Sarcasm freak</li>
    </ol>
    <p>All in all, she makes me happy! I love kitty. She is awesome</p>
    <p>Here she is:</p>
